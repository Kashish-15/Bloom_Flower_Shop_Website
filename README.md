# 🌸 Bloom Flower Shop

**Bloom Flower Shop** is a fully functional flower e-commerce website built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to browse beautiful flower products, add them to a cart or favourites list, and even take a personalized bouquet customization quiz — all without any backend. This project was made **completely from scratch** as a personal learning and portfolio project.
